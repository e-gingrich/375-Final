# 375-Final

# Lab 1: A01Primitives
  Created a few basic primitive shapes such as triangles, triangle fans, etc. (not included in this github).
# Lab 2: A02Mesh
  Created our first mesh, gave the camera the ability to move, created more complex 3-D shapes within the mesh.
# Lab 3: A03Camera
  Made the camera better, giving it the ability to rotate various directions. Learned about projection and view matrices, as well as some glm functions like perspective and rotate.
# Lab 4: A04Vector
  Wrote our own Vector3 class, which was used for the camera, giving us the ability to store keys and give constant movement and rotation.
# Lab 5: A05Matrix
  Wrote out own Matrix3 class, which used the Vector3 class and further improved the camera by giving us the ability to rotate without glm functions.
# Lab 6: A06Transform
  Wrote the Transform class, a special type of Matrix4. Built out of both Vector3 and Matrix3, this class enabled us to use the mouse and mouse buttons to rotate, as well as scale and rotate the mesh using key controls.
# Lab 7: A07Projection
  Wrote the Matrix4 class, enabling us to rewrite more camera functions and enabled us to use different projections types (ortographic, symmetric, and assymmetric). Also allowed us to zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.
# Lab 8: A08Models
  Implemented indexing of vertices, multiple meshes for colors and normals, and model importing.

Things not covered because of time: animation and large scale hierarchael models.
